# UCB Module 5 Assignment: Coupon Analysis

## Objective

The objective of this project is to employ visualizations and probability distributions to differentiate between customers who accepted a driving coupon and those who did not.

## Observations after overall Coupon Analysis
a. Overall, 56.9% of customers accepted the coupon

b. The Coffee House received the highest acceptance rate, while expensive restaurants encountered the lowest acceptance. 

c. Notably, the percentage of coupons being accepted rather than rejected was highest for Carry out and affordable restaurants.

d. Most frequently occurring temperature at the time when the passenger received the coupon was 80 degrees.

## Observations After Bar Coupon Analysis

41% bar coupons accepted by customers

The following passenger characteristics are strongly associated with accepting the bar coupon:

Being younger drivers, predominantly in the age range of 21 to 26.

Visiting bars approximately 3 or more times. Traveling alone in their vehicles.

Occupations outside of farming, fishing, and forestry. 

Drivers with kids as passengers less likely to accept the bar coupons

## Observations After Carry out & Take Away coupon Analysis
73% Carry out & Take Away coupons are accepted.

Male with 21 accepted the coupons more than any one else. Interestingly, females of age 50plus accepted more. Female age 30 or more rejected more carry out & take away coupons

The acceptance & rejection creteria for males under 21 is almost same for carry out take away coupons.

male and single OR male and under age of 21 acceptane is 75% which is slightly higher than the others.


## Next Steps 
Curious to see how the drivers with self driving cars react for the bar coupons.

Would like to analyze if a restaurant offers both car coupons and food coupons.

How does holiday times or demographics impacts drivers decisions?
